Legal Programs:
mathOp: A longer program I wrote that contains most but not all tokens. Test with the inputs labeled mathOp. Files test various inputs of positive, negative, and various operations for the different if statements
printX: This is just the program off the slides. Very basic, no input required, run with blank.txt or any other file
printXOL: Same as the last one but all on one line to test different whitespace
readPrintX: Same program but takes X as input instead of output, run with x.txt

Illegal Programs:
printXRB: The same as readPrintX but test with blank.txt, should throw an EOF error

printXUI: Tests uninitialized variable error
